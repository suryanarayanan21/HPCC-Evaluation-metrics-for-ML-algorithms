# Metrics to be implemented

Currently, this list is a collection of candidate evaluation metrics that must be examined to see whether they can be added to the framework.

| Category | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | Area Under ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) Curve ([more](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/classification/roc-and-auc)) |
| Classification | F-score |
| Classification | Matthews correlation coefficient | 
| Multilabel classification | Hamming Loss |
| Clustering | Adjusted Rand Index ([Source](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#adjusted-rand-index)) ([more](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering-performance-evaluation)) |
| Clustering | Silhouette Analysis ([more](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/cluster/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.html)) |
| Clustering | Sum of Squared Errors (SSE) |
| Feature Selection | Chi squared feature test |
