# Silhouette coefficient
Silhouette analysis is a way to measure how close each point in a cluster is to the points in its neighboring clusters as well as in its own cluster. It provides an easy way to find out the optimum value for k during k-means clustering. 

Silhouette values lie in the range of (-1, 1). A value of +1 indicates that the sample point is far away from its neighboring cluster and very close to the cluster it is assigned. Similarly, a value of -1 indicates that the point is closer to its neighboring cluster than to the cluster it is assigned.
